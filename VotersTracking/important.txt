Navigate to your project root:
Open your terminal and navigate to the root of your project (the onlineReg folder).
Copycd path/to/onlineReg

Check your current branch:
It's good to know which branch you're currently on.
Copygit status

Create and switch to a new branch:
Let's create a new branch called file-upload-local. You can name it whatever you prefer.
Copygit checkout -b file-upload-local
This command creates a new branch and switches to it immediately.
Verify you're on the new branch:
Copygit status
You should see a message indicating you're on the file-upload-local branch.
Push the new branch to your remote repository (optional):
If you want to push this branch to your remote repository (like GitHub), you can do:
Copygit push -u origin file-upload-local


Now you're on a new branch and can start making changes without affecting your main branch. When you're ready to commit your changes, you can do so as usual:
Copygit add .
git commit -m "Implement local file storage for uploads"
git push
When you've finished implementing and testing the new feature, you can merge it back into your main branch.
Remember:

Always commit your changes before switching branches.
If you need to switch back to your main branch at any point, use git checkout main (or whatever your main branch is called).
If you want to see all branches, use git branch -a.
